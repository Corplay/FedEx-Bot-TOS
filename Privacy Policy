At FedEx Bot, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy outlines the information we collect, how it is used, and your rights regarding your personal data.

Information We Collect

Usage Data: We may collect non-personally identifiable information such as command usage, server activity, and interaction logs. This data helps us improve the performance of FedEx Bot.
Personal Information: FedEx Bot does not intentionally collect personal information (such as name, email, or address) unless it is provided directly through a specific feature or service (e.g., custom user settings or configuration).
How We Use Your Data

The data we collect is used for improving the functionality of FedEx Bot, providing better support, and ensuring a smoother experience for all users.
We do not share, sell, or disclose your personal information to third parties for marketing or other unrelated purposes.
Bot Commands & Data Storage

The bot may temporarily store data to process commands (such as tracking requests or user interactions), but this data is not retained permanently unless required for specific features (e.g., reminders or settings).
Any sensitive data shared with the bot, such as tracking numbers or server configurations, will not be shared with any third parties without your consent.
Third-Party Services

FedEx Bot may use third-party services (such as APIs) to enhance certain features (e.g., delivering tracking information or interacting with other platforms). These services may have their own privacy policies, which we recommend you review.
Data Retention

We retain usage data for as long as necessary to provide our services and for internal analysis. Personal data is not stored beyond what is needed for specific bot functionality.
Security

We take reasonable precautions to protect the data collected and stored by FedEx Bot from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.
Your Rights

You have the right to access, correct, or delete any data collected by FedEx Bot, depending on the features you use.
If you wish to stop using FedEx Bot and delete any stored data, simply remove the bot from your server or stop interacting with it.
